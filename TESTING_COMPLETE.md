## 🧪 **Manual Testing Guide**

Since the backend is fully functional, you can test manually:

### **Test 1: GraphQL Playground**
Visit: `http://localhost:3001/dev/graphql`

**Phone Verification:**
```graphql
mutation {
  sendPhoneVerification(phoneNumber: "+18323891266") {
    sessionId
    message
  }
}
```

**Code Verification (use 123456 for development):**
```graphql
mutation {
  verifyPhoneCode(sessionId: "YOUR_SESSION_ID", code: "123456") {
    token
    user {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      phoneNumber
    }
  }
}
```

### **Test 2: AI Card Generation**
```graphql
mutation {
  drawCard {
    title
    description
    kinkFactor
    category
    tags
  }
}
```
